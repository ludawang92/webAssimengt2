<h1>Why am here in MSIS</h1>

<p style="font-size:17px">Finding a good job following graduation is key to establishing the career I hope to have for a lifetime. Although entering my dream company, Goldman Sachs, right after graduation might prove difficult and cannot be guaranteed, I am also interested in working with a small investment firm, which would be a great way to better understand the industry and establish myself faster than in larger companies. I am further certain the MSIS curriculum will be unlike any other, establishing a thorough foundation and focusing on career-driven advancement in the field. Already a well-prepared student academically and practically, my skills combined with my aspirational personality prove my potential as a graduate candidate and will contribute to my success in the future. </p>
